# 🎞️ YouTube Metadata NFO Generator for Jellyfin

This project automatically processes downloaded YouTube videos into [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)-compatible `.nfo` files and thumbnails, making your media library look professional and organized.

It uses:
- `yt-dlp` to fetch video and channel metadata
- `sharp` to convert `.webp` thumbnails to `.jpg`
- Custom Node.js logic to generate `.nfo` files for both videos and channels
